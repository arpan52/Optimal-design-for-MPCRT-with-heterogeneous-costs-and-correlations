# Codes for Optimal design for matched pair cluster-randomized trials with heterogeneous correlations and costs
This repository contains all the **R codes** used in the revised version of the paper *Optimal Design for Matched Pair Cluster-Randomized Trials with Heterogeneous Correlations and Costs*. The R code filenames are self-explanatory, making it easy to reproduce all the results presented in the paper. The main R script for computing the locally optimal design is **Cost_opt_design_U.L.R**.  

Additionally, this repository includes the original **MATLAB** codes that were used in the initial version of the paper. While these codes can still reproduce the earlier results, all computations in the revised version have been implemented in R. Users are advised to use the R codes for consistency with the final results in the paper.
